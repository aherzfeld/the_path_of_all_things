          "info": "At a timescale of roughly 10^67 years, even the most massive black holes in the universe will have evaporated completely through Hawking radiation. This quantum mechanical process causes black holes to emit faint radiation and lose mass at an extraordinarily slow rate.\n\nThe evaporation of the last black holes marks the end of the last complex structures in the universe. After this point, nothing remains but a thin, cooling soup of photons, neutrinos, and scattered subatomic particles drifting ever farther apart.",

          "info": "At a timescale of 10^100 years and beyond, the universe reaches its final state: heat death. All energy has been evenly distributed across an incomprehensibly vast cosmos. No temperature differences exist to drive any physical processes. No structures of any kind remain. Entropy has reached its absolute maximum.\n\nHeat death is the ultimate consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. The universe, which began in the extraordinarily hot, dense, low-entropy state of the Big Bang, has spent its entire existence spreading energy outward and cooling down. In the end, it reaches perfect equilibrium \u2014 a silent, changeless void.",
